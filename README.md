## ÔøΩÔøΩ Quick Start

### Installation

Download the latest DMG file from the [Releases](https://github.com/SakuraKy/MicroMasters/releases) page and double-click to install.

### macOS Installation Issues

When installing on macOS, you may encounter the error **"MicroMasters.app" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.** This is generally not actual file corruption. In fact, to completely avoid this issue, we would need to pay Apple $99 per year to generate a trusted certificate. We don't have the ability to pay this amount. If you want to use this software, you may need some additional steps to complete this.

1. Download and drag to Application directory.
2. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/MicroMasters.app
```

3. Open the application and start using.

### Build from Source
